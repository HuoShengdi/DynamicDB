This app renders the contents of a customer database storing name, location and age, and allows the user to filter the entries of the DB,
dynamically rerendering the results as they type.
A dropdown menu allows the user to select which attribute(s) they wish to filter results by. Name is selected by default.

The interface also allows the user to edit customer entries in the DB. Clicking the Edit button converts the table entry into a form.
Once the user is finished editing the data, submitting the form sends the new data to the backend and triggers a refresh of the table upon success.
